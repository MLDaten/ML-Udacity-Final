# Capstone Project: Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers

Knowing exactly the count of a physical inventory has been a key issue in all industries that are involved in manufacturing and retail processes. Historically, this is a job that warehouse managers and supply chain professionals have performed through cycle counting, an audit process for managing inventory counts.

In this notebook, a solution for object counting based in Machine Learning,is presented. The solution uses the Pytorch framework available from AWS SageMaker. The goal is to deploy a SageMaker endpoint that will query images to get predictions about the number of objects in the submitted image.
